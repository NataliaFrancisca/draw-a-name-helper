# üÄÑ **DRAW A NAME HELPER**

**DRAW A NAME** is a web application that allows you to draw names from a list you register.

‚≠ê This project was built to practice my knowledge in React.JS and Tailwind CSS.

üö® I still need to implement tests for this application

## **Stack**:
- React.js
- Tailwind CSS

## **Functionalities**:
    1. Register a name
    2. Delete a name
    2. View the registered names
    4. Draw a name each time you click the button *
       * You can draw names until the list is empty

## **Preview:**
